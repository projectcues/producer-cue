    apis: (type) => `All APIs defined in the ${type}. APIs are used to fetch data from external services or backend systems. They can be called via actions and their data can be used in formulas.`,
    children: `A list of child node IDs. Every ID must correspond to a node defined in the "nodes" object of the component/page that includes this component node.`,
    condition: (type) => `Formula evaluating to whether this ${type} is rendered or not. If false, undefined or null the ${type} is not rendered. Any other value means the ${type} is rendered.`,
    formulas: (type) => `All formulas defined in the ${type}. Formulas are used to compute dynamic values based on variables, inputs, or other data.`,
    metadata: (type) => `Metadata associated with this ${type}. This can include comments and other information useful for understanding the ${type}.`,
    onAttributeChange: (type) => `Lifecycle event that is triggered when any of the ${type} attributes change. Declared actions will be executed in response to attribute changes, allowing the ${type} to react dynamically to different configurations.`,

This is important for ensuring that the ${type} instances are correctly identified and managed during re-renders. This is rarely needed for simple arrays but is critical when rendering complex objects or when the array items can change dynamically.`,
    slot: (type) => `Slot name for when this ${type} is rendered inside a component. Slot name must match the slot defined in the parent component. The default slot name is: "default".`,
    style: (type) => `This is the default style for this ${type}.`,
    testData: (type) => `Test value for the ${type}. Test data is only used while building in the Nordcraft editor.`,
    variables: (type) => `All variables defined in the ${type}. Variables hold dynamic data that can be used throughout the ${type} via formulas. They can be updated via actions.`,
    variants: (type) => `Style variants defined on this ${type}. This could be a variant for hover, active, focus, media queries, or other state-based styles. Or even based on a class.`,
    workflows: (type) => `All workflows defined in the ${type}. Workflows are sequences of actions that can be triggered by events or other workflows. They define the behavior of the ${type}.`,
